# Lab

The lab assignments for the course are available in the [dcai-lab](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab) repository.

Remember to run a `git pull` before doing every lab, to make sure you have the latest version of the labs.

The lab assignment for this class is in [`prompt_engineering/Lab_Prompt_Engineering.ipynb`](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab/blob/master/prompt_engineering/Lab_Prompt_Engineering.ipynb) (also available on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cipH-u6Jz0EH-6Cd9MPYgY4K0sJZwRJq)). This lab guides you through prompt engineering, crafting inputs for large language models (LLMs). With these large pre-trained models, even small amounts of data can make them very useful.
