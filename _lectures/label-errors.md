# Lab

The lab assignments for the course are available in the [dcai-lab](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab) repository.

Remember to run a `git pull` before doing every lab, to make sure you have the latest version of the labs.

The lab assignment for this class is in [`label_errors/Lab - Label Errors.ipynb`](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab/blob/master/label_errors/Lab%20-%20Label%20Errors.ipynb). This lab guides you through writing your own implementation of automatic label error identification using Confident Learning, the technique taught in today's lecture.
