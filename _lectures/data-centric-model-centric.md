# Lab

The lab assignments for the course are available in the [dcai-lab](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab) repository.

Get started with:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab
```

Remember to run a `git pull` before doing every lab, to make sure you have the latest version of the labs.

The first lab assignment, in [`data_centric_model_centric/Lab - Data-Centric AI vs Model-Centric AI.ipynb`](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab/blob/master/data_centric_model_centric/Lab%20-%20Data-Centric%20AI%20vs%20Model-Centric%20AI.ipynb), walks you through an ML task of building a text classifier, and illustrates the power (and often simplicity) of data-centric approaches.
