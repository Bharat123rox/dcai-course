# Lab

The lab assignments for the course are available in the [dcai-lab](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab) repository.

Remember to run a `git pull` before doing every lab, to make sure you have the latest version of the labs.

The lab assignment for this class is in [`interpretable_features/Lab - Interpretable Features.ipynb`](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab/blob/master/interpretable_features/Lab%20-%20Interpretable%20Features.ipynb). This lab guides you through finding issues in a dataset's features by applying interpretability techniques.
